# Interface example in java

Here we have a little java project to you understand how interface works.

## The context

I was thinking in a School that we have 2 types of studients.

Abstract classes
- Person
- Studients

Interfaces
- Developer (Methods of a developer studient)
- Farmer (Methods of a farmer studient)
- Studient (Methods of a default studient)

Concrete class:
- DeveloperStudient
- MapStudient



I guess that can improve your knowledge.
